# LHL Pollster Project

Pollster is a full stack web application. 
A user is able to create a poll with a question and up to 3 options. Our app would save the data into database and generate two links sending to user's email through emailgun. User is able to share the links with his/her friends to vote and view results. Based on the friends's votes, our app would generate a ranking table for the poll.
